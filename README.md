# cg2vec
repository for code_graph to vector

### todo
1. random walk: need tests (especially coverage)
2. standardlized variance
3. overall variance compute
4. compute naturalness
5. larger dataset
6. train embeddings for nl
7. for structure embs, shuold use G1/1 rather than jimle as ID?
